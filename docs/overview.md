# Eggshot

**Eggshot** is a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) arena game where players control egg-shaped characters in intense multiplayer combat. Inspired by *Shell Shockers*, this project is built using **Bevy 0.15.3** and targets desktop platforms.

The game will feature:
- Deterministic simulation suitable for synchronization via the **Tashi Consensus Engine (TCE)**
- Fast-paced, rollback-driven multiplayer gameplay
- Modular ECS-based architecture for scalability and clarity
- LAN support with lobby creation and ready-up system
